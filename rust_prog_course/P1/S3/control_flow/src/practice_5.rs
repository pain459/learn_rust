// Problem 5:


/*
A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, satisfying the condition a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
These triples are commonly written as (a, b, c), and a well-known example is (3, 4, 5).

Write a program that computes the Pythagorean triplet such that a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000.
